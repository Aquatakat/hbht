# Reference rig (roadmap 0.1)

The emulator setup used as ground truth for the life of the project.

## ROMs

ROMs live in `roms/` (gitignored). Never commit ROM-derived data.

| File | Rev byte `0x3F` | SHA-1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Aidyn Chronicles - The First Mage (U) (V1.0) [!].z64` | `00` | `47ae795a2b12783a13e2b8d03439ce9a39fc826c` |
| `Aidyn Chronicles - The First Mage (U) (V1.1).z64` | `01` | `f80e135e7e962308f51bb9f7600b25213549c688` |
| `AidynDebug.z64` (02.01d-PRERELEASE) | n/a (blank header) | `8169959ae059869b46461712a829ca0fe15c902c` |

All three are big-endian `.z64`, 32 MB, with the retail CIC-6102 IPL3 and valid header checksums. Retail game code is `NAYE`. The debug ROM has no internal name or game code. How the versions differ is in [formats/rom.md](formats/rom.md).

## Emulator: ares v148

Installed with winget (`ares-emulator.ares`). Launch through the script, which enables the GDB server for that run only:

```powershell
tools/ares.ps1 debug      # or v10, v11; -SaveState 1..9 to load a slot
```

- The GDB server listens on port 9123. Note that it binds `0.0.0.0`, so it is reachable from the LAN while running.
- `Input/Defocus` is overridden to `Allow`. The user setting is `Pause`, which freezes emulation as soon as gdb takes focus. If the PC is stuck in IPL3 (`0xA40014xx`), this setting is the cause.
- The Expansion Pak is on (the ares default). This matches the set of map objects the reimplementation targets.
- **Pin ares at v148.** Save states are tied to the emulator version.

## Debugger: gdb-multiarch 18.1 (MSYS2 UCRT64)

Located at `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin\gdb-multiarch.exe`.

```
gdb-multiarch -ex "set architecture mips:4300" -ex "set endian big" -ex "target remote 127.0.0.1:9123"
```

Resolve addresses against the decomp's `symbol_addrs.debug.txt` (debug ROM) or `symbol_addrs.us.txt` (1.0). A first attach to the debug ROM sampled `InitProc+0x1fc` and libultra thread code, which confirms the game is running.

## Engine: Godot 4.7.2 (.NET)

ADR 0002 has the Godot version pinned in the repository. `tools/godot.ps1` runs the pinned editor. On first use it downloads `Godot_v4.7.2-stable_mono_win64.zip` from the official GitHub release, checks it against the release's SHA-512 and unpacks it into the gitignored `.tools/godot/`. The editor runs self-contained (the `._sc_` file beside it), so its settings and caches stay in `.tools/` and don't touch another Godot install. The script runs the console build, so Godot's output and exit code reach the terminal.

```powershell
tools/godot.ps1 --path src/Aidyn.Inspector --editor   # the editor
tools/godot.ps1 --path src/Aidyn.Inspector            # run the project
tools/godot.ps1 -ExePath                              # print the executable's path
```

- **The pin is in two places:** the version and hash in `tools/godot.ps1`, and `Godot.NET.Sdk/4.7.2` in each Godot project's `.csproj`. Change them together.
- **Godot projects state `TargetFramework` themselves.** The editor doesn't see `Directory.Build.props`, and if the `.csproj` has no `TargetFramework` it writes in its own default, `net8.0`, which can't reference the net10 libraries. Godot 4.7.2 runs net10 assemblies without trouble.
- **No `.sln` is needed.** The editor builds the `.csproj`, and `dotnet build` builds Godot projects like any other, into `.godot/mono/temp/bin/`. The project's `.godot/` folder is a cache and is gitignored. The `.uid` files Godot writes beside scripts are committed.

## Existing saves

Mupen64Plus saves are in `%APPDATA%\Mupen64Plus\save`. Only `AIDYN_CHRONICLES (unknown rom).mpk` (Oct 2025) holds Aidyn data. The other Aidyn `.mpk` files are empty paks.

Mupen `.mpk` files are four 32 KB paks back to back. The saves are in pak 1, in four 28-page notes (`NAYE`/`78`, "CHRONICLES" A–D). Their `SaveDatStruct` headers (see `include/savefiles.h` in the decomp) decode as the table below. Play time is `PlayTime` in 60 Hz ticks (`TICKSPERSECOND`, `world.h`), advanced by the frame delta. The frame delta counts 60 Hz polls and is capped at 1–6. The map position is the chunk the debug overlay shows as `mapShort1 + 'A'-1` followed by `mapShort2`.

| Slot | Play time | Flags set | Chunk | Party IDs | Story position (user) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B | 7:45:26 | 315 | P17 | 23f 24c 243 24a | Before Shamsuk's Tower |
| C | 17:17:43 | 547 | B01 | 23f 24c 243 24d | Before Rooughah |
| A | 18:04:28 | 562 | M06 | 23f 24c 243 24d | Before the final encounter |
| D | 18:44:19 | 580 | G01 | 23f 24c 243 24d | Before Rooughah, in Terminor. This is the latest save; the user walked back across the map to stand by a horse. |

All slots are named "Alaron". The playthrough used a hacked ROM with low-level enemies, so party stats, equipment and spells are below par for the story position. These saves are good for flag, map and quest state, but not for combat parity. All four load on the debug ROM too.

### Converting Mupen `.mpk` to ares `.pak`

ares stores one 32 KB Controller Pak next to the ROM as `<rom basename>.pak`. It uses the same raw big-endian layout as Mupen, so converting means taking the first 32 KB:

```bash
head -c 32768 "AIDYN_CHRONICLES (unknown rom).mpk" > "roms/Aidyn Chronicles - The First Mage (U) (V1.0) [!].pak"
```

This was checked against an ares-written `AidynDebug.pak`. Note table, inode table and save data layout are identical. The only difference is the page-0 ID block: Mupen writes a fixed template with serial `051a5f13`, and ares writes its own. Both pass libultra's ID checksums in all four copies (`0x20/0x60/0x80/0xC0`) and the inode-table checksums. The game's own save checksum sits inside the note data, so it is unaffected.

The debug and retail saves use the same note (`NAYE`/`78`, "CHRONICLES"), the same 28-page size, and the same header layout. Whether the debug ROM can load a retail save, which would put the flag viewer on a late-game state, is untested.

## Debug ROM controls

These are gated on `gDebugFlag` (`0x800E68A0`), which is on in the debug build. Sources are in the decomp.

| Input (overworld) | Effect | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C-up | Cycle the performance overlay (6 states): memory bars, object count, ground type, chunk plus position, fps | `PlayerMove.cpp`, `app.cpp` |
| **L + Start** | **Open the big debug menu** | `gametrek.cpp` |
| R + A (minimap open) | Minimap shows everything | `gametrek.cpp` |
| L + D-left | Load only the centre map chunk | `PlayerMove.cpp` |
| R + D-right | Replace the next loaded scene objects with boulders (reference objects) | `PlayerMove.cpp` |

Big debug menu entries (`debug_menu_funcs` in `debug.cpp`; labels come from `COMMONSTRING_DebugBigMenu00+i`):

| # | Function |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | `debug_gamestatefunnel`: the event-flag viewer and editor |
| 2 | `gamestste_cheats` |
| 3 | `debug_add_party_member` |
| 14 | Clear inventory |
| 15 | Play the credits |
| 16 | Unused debug toggle widget |
| 17 | Toggle enemies hostile |
| 18 | Toggle "only teleporters active" |
| 19 | Item DB browser: armor, shield, item, weapon, potion; A adds the item to the inventory |
| 20 | Bad-reference object hunt (voxel index display) |

Entries 1 and 4–13 are null in the function table.

## Checkpoint library

Save states are captured by the user playing, not scripted. They live in `roms/` and are named `<rom basename> - <label>.bsN`. They were made with ares v148, whose state header reads `BST1` with serializer tag `v152`. Each state's `PlayTime` was read back with `tools/bst.py`, and all eight match their pak slot plus the time spent before saving the state.

| Label | Pak slot | 1.0 state `PlayTime` | Debug state `PlayTime` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Before Shamsuk's Tower | B | 7:45:33 | 7:45:42 |
| Before Rooughah | C | 17:18:24 | 17:18:00 |
| Before final encounter | A | 18:04:54 | 18:06:44 |
| Before Rooughah, in Terminor | D | 18:45:11 | 18:44:32 |

Load a checkpoint by label:

```powershell
tools/ares.ps1 debug -Checkpoint "Before final encounter"
```

This copies the named state to the ROM's `.bs9` slot and passes `--save-state 9`. Slot 9 is scratch, and the named files are never written. The ares slot convention is `<rom basename>.bsN`.

### Emulator captures

The user's screenshots of the original, for matching UI against. They live in `roms/` with the checkpoints, named for what they show, such as `menu-party-inventory-info.png` (the pause menu's Party tab with an item's details open). ares saves them at 2560 × 960, four times the 640 × 240 its video output gives (see [ui](systems/ui.md#the-screen)), so taking every fourth pixel both ways recovers that exactly; doubling its lines then shows it at 4:3.

### Reading the original's code: `tools/n64dis.py`

The decomp's pseudocode is often wrong in the details: a field read from the wrong object, a constant misread, a loop that restarts. When a value or a branch matters, read the machine code. `n64dis.py` disassembles a function by the decomp's symbol (from `ref/Aidyn/symbol_addrs.<rom>.txt`), naming the functions it calls and the floats it loads, and reads data as floats and doubles. It needs `pip install capstone`.

```bash
python tools/n64dis.py --find wander                 # symbols whose names hold the text
python tools/n64dis.py WanderTick                    # a function, in 1.0 (or --rom debug)
python tools/n64dis.py 0x8000f5b4 --count 60         # from an address
python tools/n64dis.py --data 0x800cdb80 --count 2   # words as hex, float and double
```

The decomp's `FUN_xxxxxxxx` names are debug-build addresses; 1.0's functions sit in the same order, so find one by its neighbours with `--find`. Check a float's bits, not just its look: `0x3E32B7FE` is 10° in radians and `0x3EB2B7FE` is 20°.

### Reading state RAM offline: `tools/bst.py`

ares states store RDRAM uncompressed as 32-bit little-endian words. `bst.py` locates RDRAM by fingerprinting the code segment against the matching ROM, found by filename prefix. It then reads it as big-endian KSEG0 addresses:

```bash
python tools/bst.py "<state>" 0x800f1bbc 16     # hexdump
python tools/bst.py "<state>" --word 0x800f1bbc # one u32
python tools/bst.py "<state>" --dump out.bin    # 8 MB RDRAM image
```

This is the preferred way to inspect checkpoints: it's deterministic, repeatable, and doesn't need a live emulator. Symbols useful so far:

| Symbol | Debug | 1.0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TerrainPointer` | `0x800F1BBC` | `0x800E303C` |
| `TerrainStruct.PlayTime` | `+0x34` | `+0x34` |
| `TerrainStruct.InGameTime` | `+0x20` | `+0x20` |

The C# side reads states with `AresCheckpoint` (`Aidyn.Rom.Rig`), which needs no ROM: it finds RDRAM by the flag table's header, which is in RAM exactly once, and whose pointers give its own address. The tests use it to check the [flag engine](systems/flags.md) against every checkpoint, and the editor loads a checkpoint's flags with it.

### Known issue: GDB after loading a state

When the debug ROM was booted with `--save-state`, gdb got `Ignoring packet error` on connect. After the failed handshake the GDB port stopped listening, and on one attempt ares stopped responding. A plain boot with no state attached fine earlier. The cause isn't isolated yet: it could be state loading, or the stub not recovering from a client that exits without detaching. Until it's fixed, use `bst.py` for checkpoint inspection and keep gdb for live sessions started from a cold boot.
